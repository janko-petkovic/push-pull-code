# A note to the user
These scripts generate a "raw" dataframe for the two main datasets
used in the work (Chater et al. 2024, Helm et al. 2022).
They receive as input the root folder of the output generated by
applying the `SpyDen` tool to the two datasets.
The locations of these root folders are hardcoded in the script, as
they are supposed to be run only once (in my case, on my main machine).

In case you have the data, SpyDen, and you want to regenerate the 
dataframes, remember to change the parameter `root` in the 
`df_from_tool` call at the beginning of each script.
